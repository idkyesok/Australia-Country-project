    <p>The arrival of British settlers in the late 18th<br> century introduced new cultural elements that have<br> become integral to modern Australia. English is the primary<br> language, and the legal and political systems<br> are based on British models. This colonial legacy is<br> also evident in the country's architecture, educational<br> institutions, and many social customs.</p>
