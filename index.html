    <h2>The country that almost covers a whole continent</h2>

            <p>The sixth largest country in the world by area, Australia is a country known for its stunning, unique landscapes and its diverse wildlife. Situated in the southern hemisphere between the Pacific and Indian oceans, the country often referred to as one half of the “Down Under” alongside neighboring New Zealand by many rather confusingly shares its name with a continent. To clear up any doubts, the country Australia is simply a nation within the Australia continent. In its past the country has shared a common distinction with many other countries of its time in that it was a part of the British empire as some of its many many colonies. Six of its many many colonies to be exact. In 1901, after being under British rule for over a 100 years these six colonies - New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania - united to form the nation known as the Commonwealth of Australia with the former colonies being adopted as the six states of Australia that still exist today.</p>

            <p>The colonization combined with a great deal of immigration from many different countries and cultures throughout its history has led to the 26.01 million population of Australia being incredibly diverse both racially and culturally. 57.2% of the population comprises those with European heritage, 33.8% of those with Oceanian heritage(some of whom are Aboriginal Australians, the indigenous people of Australia), 17.4% of those with Asian heritage and the rest are filled with people from the Americas and Africa. As you can imagine this has also resulted in varied religious affiliation for the people of the country. With 43.9% of the country identifying themselves as Christians, 38.9% believing in no religion, 3.2% being Muslim, 2.7% being Hindu and 2.4% being Buddhist.

            <p>In addition to the diversity in its residents, Australia is also incredibly diverse in its wildlife. From koalas to kangaroos. From wombats to the neatly named Tasmanian devils. These creatures and the sheer variety of species located in the country has contributed to tourism being one of the most focal aspects of Australia’s economy. And this is just one reason to visit Australia. There are so many other wonderful things to do. Such as visiting some of the most beautiful beaches in the world where world class surfing and unique marine life are a staple. Or you may visit the Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park, a sacred place to the local Aṉangu people that is home to 36 rock domes that cover up to 20 square kilometers and rise up to 546 meters above ground. The place serves as an excellent showcase of culture belonging to the Aboriginal Australians. You may also choose to watch turtles hatch in Queensland or even explore the laneways of Melbourne.

                Traveling to Australia is possible via two routes, the air and the sea. With flight operators such as Qantas, Virgin, Delta, United, American Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines and Jetstar being at your disposal from the US and Canada. Non-direct flights are also an option you may consider with Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Hong Kong and Singapore being some of the international layover destinations. In regards to sailing, there are many operators that allow you to travel directly from the US to Australia such as Cunard, Holland America, Royal Caribbean and Oceania.

                Once you get to Australia, there are a variety of places to visit and stay. If you want to experience the buzzing nightlife and see some of the most popular landmarks in the country then Sydney is certainly the place for you. Metro Residences Darling Harbour is an excellent choice if you are looking for a hotel that meets your needs. If you instead want to visit museums with an incredible amount of content, see animal attractions and a variety of restaurants then Melbourne is the place to go to. The Victoria Hotel is a good choice if you are looking for an affordable hotel. There are also places such as Whitsundays that would be more suitable for couples and Adelaide which while not being as popular as Sydney or Melbourne is still a very good tourist destination.
